### CPSC 120
* Lab 7
    One of my favorite labs I have done was lab 7 part 2. This lab was all about making a BlackJack game. We used functions and loops to draw cards and create comments like BUST! WINNER! And etc. I learned how to use functions.
* Lab 6 
    Another Lab I enjoyed doing was lab 6 part 2. This lab was making a guessing game. We created loops and statements which were fun to do, until you guessed the number to 1-100. I learned how to use while, if loops.
* Lab 3 
    The last lab that was one of my favorites was lab 3 part 1. This lab was making a sandwich out of doing coding. This lab we learned how to use statements such as cout and cin, and how to declare strings.
